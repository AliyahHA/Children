        <div class="section abstract" id="abstract"><h2>Abstract</h2><p id="p-1">Play 
            is essential to development because it contributes to the cognitive, physical,
             social, and emotional well-being of children and youth. Play also offers an ideal 
             opportunity for parents to engage fully with their children. Despite the benefits derived 
             from play for both children and parents, time for free play has been markedly reduced for some children.
              This report addresses a variety of factors that have reduced play, including a hurried lifestyle, changes 
              in family structure, and increased attention to academics and enrichment activities at the expense of recess
               or free child-centered play. This report offers guidelines on how pediatricians can advocate for children 
               by helping families, school systems, and communities consider how best to ensure that play is protected as 
               they seek the balance
             in childrenâ€™s lives to create the optimal developmental milieu.</p></div>
